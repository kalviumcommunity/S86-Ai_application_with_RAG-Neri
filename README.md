# Neri

## AI-Powered Maintenance Troubleshooting Assistant

Neri is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help manufacturing floor technicians troubleshoot machine problems using approved technical documentation.

Instead of relying only on general AI knowledge, Neri retrieves relevant information from authorized machine manuals, maintenance logs, and safety procedures before generating a troubleshooting response.

> **Neri helps technicians find the right information faster — it does not control machines or perform repairs autonomously.**

---

## Problem Statement

Maintenance teams often have access to machine manuals, maintenance records, and safety procedures, but finding the correct information during a machine problem can take valuable time.

Neri connects these sources into a single troubleshooting workflow so technicians can:

- Describe a machine problem in natural language.
- Retrieve relevant approved documentation.
- Identify possible causes.
- Follow grounded troubleshooting steps.
- View the sources used to generate the answer.
- See relevant safety warnings.
- Review previous troubleshooting sessions.

---

## Objectives

Neri is designed to:

- Reduce time spent searching maintenance documentation.
- Provide grounded troubleshooting guidance.
- Connect machine problems with relevant maintenance information.
- Surface safety information before troubleshooting.
- Provide traceable source references.
- Avoid generating unsupported maintenance procedures.
- Maintain a history of troubleshooting sessions.

---

## Key Features

### 1. AI Troubleshooting

Technicians provide:

- Machine name
- Machine ID
- Problem description
- Optional error code

Neri retrieves relevant documentation and generates a structured troubleshooting response.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Neri follows a RAG pipeline:

    User Problem
         |
         v
    Query Processing
         |
         v
    Gemini Embedding
         |
         v
    ChromaDB Retrieval
         |
         v
    Relevant Documentation
         |
         v
    Grounded LLM Generation
         |
         v
    Troubleshooting Response

### 3. Source References

Generated answers are accompanied by source information such as:

- Document name
- Document type
- Section
- Page number

This allows technicians to verify the information against the original documentation.

### 4. Safety Guidance

Neri supports safety documentation as a dedicated document type.

Safety-related information is treated separately from ordinary maintenance information to reduce the risk of unsupported safety instructions.

### 5. No-Reliable-Answer Handling

When relevant approved documentation cannot be found, Neri does not intentionally invent an answer.

Instead, it returns a message indicating that there is not enough approved information to provide a reliable answer.

### 6. Troubleshooting History

Previous troubleshooting sessions can be viewed through the History section.

Each session stores:

- Machine
- Machine ID
- Problem
- Error code
- Generated response
- Feedback
- Timestamp

### 7. Feedback

Users can mark troubleshooting responses as:

- Helpful
- Not helpful

Optional feedback comments can also be recorded.

### 8. Document Management

Authorized users can upload approved documentation.

Supported document types:

- Manual
- Maintenance Log
- Safety

Supported file formats:

- PDF
- TXT

Document metadata includes:

- Machine
- Version
- Owner
- Document type
- Processing status
- Number of indexed chunks

### 9. Role-Based Access

Neri currently supports two application roles.

#### Technician

Can:

- Troubleshoot machines
- View troubleshooting history
- Submit feedback

#### Supervisor

Can:

- Troubleshoot machines
- View troubleshooting history
- Submit feedback

## RAG Pipeline

Neri uses the following retrieval workflow.

### 1. Document Upload

An authorized user uploads a PDF or TXT document.

The document can be classified as:

- Manual
- Maintenance Log
- Safety

Additional metadata can include:

- Machine
- Version
- Owner

### 2. Document Extraction

Text is extracted from the document.

For PDFs, page information is retained where available.

### 3. Text Cleaning

Extracted text is cleaned before indexing.

### 4. Chunking

Large documents are divided into smaller chunks so relevant sections can be retrieved independently.

### 5. Embedding

Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using Gemini Embeddings.

### 6. Vector Storage

Embeddings and their metadata are stored in ChromaDB.

### 7. Query Embedding

When a technician submits a problem, the query is converted into an embedding.

### 8. Retrieval

ChromaDB retrieves the most relevant indexed chunks.

Neri also applies machine-specific filtering so documentation assigned to another machine is not used for the troubleshooting request.

### 9. Grounded Generation

The retrieved documentation is passed to Gemini as context.

The model is instructed to use the supplied documentation rather than inventing procedures.

### 10. Source Mapping

The retrieved chunks are converted into source references that are returned with the response.

---

## Safety and Hallucination Guardrails

Neri is designed for a maintenance environment where incorrect instructions can create operational or safety risks.

The system therefore follows several rules.

### Approved Documentation

The generated troubleshooting response is based on retrieved approved documentation.

### No Invented Procedures

Neri is instructed not to create maintenance or safety procedures that are not supported by the retrieved documentation.

### Safety Evidence

Safety-related information should be supported by safety documentation.

### No Autonomous Machine Control

Neri does not:

- Control machines
- Send machine commands
- Perform repairs
- Operate equipment
- Monitor machines in real time

### No Reliable Answer

If sufficient documentation cannot be found, Neri can refuse to provide a troubleshooting answer instead of presenting unsupported information as fact.

## Example Troubleshooting Flow

A technician enters:

    Machine:
    CNC Mill

    Machine ID:
    CNC-001

    Problem:
    Machine is overheating

    Error Code:
    E102

Neri then:

    1. Creates the search query
            |
            v
    2. Generates the query embedding
            |
            v
    3. Searches ChromaDB
            |
            v
    4. Retrieves relevant documentation
            |
            v
    5. Filters documentation for the selected machine
            |
            v
    6. Checks whether usable evidence exists
            |
            v
    7. Sends retrieved context to Gemini
            |
            v
    8. Generates structured troubleshooting guidance
            |
            v
    9. Adds source references
            |
            v
    10. Saves the session to history

---

## Response Structure

A successful troubleshooting response can contain:

    Possible Causes
           |
           v
    Safety Warning
           |
           v
    Troubleshooting Steps
           |
           v
    Source References

If sufficient evidence is not available:

    No Reliable Answer
           |
           v
    We couldn't find enough information in
    approved documentation to provide a reliable answer.
